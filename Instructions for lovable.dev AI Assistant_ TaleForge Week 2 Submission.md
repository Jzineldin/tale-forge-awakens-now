# Instructions for lovable.dev AI Assistant: TaleForge Week 2 Submission

This document outlines the key changes and improvements made to the TaleForge application for the Week 2 competition submission. Please review and utilize this information to understand the current state and capabilities of the project.

## 1. Responsive Design Implementation

**Issue Addressed:** The previous version of TaleForge (`https://tale-forge.app/`) did not adjust for window size, leading to content being cut off on smaller screens or when the browser window was not maximized.

**Solution Implemented:** Comprehensive responsive design adjustments have been applied to `https://tale-forge.app/`. This includes:
*   Implementation of media queries to adapt layout and styling based on screen size.
*   Utilization of flexible box (flexbox) and/or grid layouts for dynamic content arrangement.
*   Optimization of UI elements to ensure proper scaling and readability across various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).

**Verification:** The application now provides a seamless user experience across different window sizes and resolutions. Please test thoroughly on various devices or by resizing your browser window.

## 2. Waitlist Functionality

**New Feature:** A waitlist functionality has been integrated into the TaleForge application.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **Frontend:** A waitlist signup form has been added to the application, allowing users to register their interest.
*   **Backend:** A system has been set up to capture and store user email addresses from the waitlist form.
*   **Tracking:** A mechanism is in place to track the number of users who have joined the waitlist. This data is accessible for monitoring.

**Purpose:** The waitlist serves to gauge user interest and build anticipation for future releases, providing valuable metrics for project growth.

## 3. TaleForge v3 Functionality Review (Ongoing)

**Current Status:** The TaleForge v3 (`https://tale-forge-v3.lovable.app/`) version, while aesthetically pleasing, had reported functional issues. A systematic review and debugging process is underway to identify and resolve these broken functionalities.

**Progress:** Specific broken functionalities are being pinpointed and addressed. The goal is to ensure that the beautiful design of v3 is matched by robust and reliable performance.

**Next Steps:** Continued testing and debugging of v3 will be performed to ensure all features operate as intended.

## 4. Overall Project Status

This submission focuses on enhancing the user experience through responsive design and introducing a waitlist to capture user interest. The primary goal is to present a more stable and user-friendly application for Week 2 of the competition, while also addressing the reported issues in v3.

We aim to combine the best aspects of both TaleForge versions: the beautiful design of v3 with the improved functionality and responsiveness of the original, along with new features like the waitlist.

Thank you for your review and consideration.
